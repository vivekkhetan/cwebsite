# Nabh Cloud — Marketing Website

Pre-launch marketing site for a sovereign cloud infrastructure & AI-enabled
software company serving SMBs in India's tier 2/3 cities. Built with React,
React Router, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

"Nabh Cloud" is a placeholder brand name — swap it, along with contact
details, in `src/data/content.js`.

## Structure

- `/` — Home (hero, why-us, condensed product/solutions overview, security
  strip, how it works, contact form)
- `/products` — full infrastructure portfolio
- `/solutions` — the four industry solution sectors
- `/security` — security & compliance detail
- `/about` — founding story and team
- `/faq` — frequently asked questions

The "Talk to Us" contact form lives on the homepage (`#contact`) and is
reachable from every page via the sticky header CTA.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # start dev server
npm run build    # production build
npm run preview  # preview the production build
```

## Content

All copy, product/sector data, FAQs, and contact details are centralized in
`src/data/content.js` for easy editing without touching component code.
